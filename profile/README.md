Hey there! 👋 I'm **Naomi** — a transfem software engineer, community manager, and (failed) VTuber who's passionate about building inclusive tech communities and breaking down barriers in the industry. I am the founder of [NHCarrigan](https://nhcarrigan.com) and the community manager for [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). Bringing these organisations together, I am running a month-long Hackathon!

## What is the hackathon?

This was a month-long event. During this time, participants worked on teams to develop real-world production-grade products. Participants will gain valuable experience working on a team, and get a sense of what it is like to work in a professional setting.

## How do I join?

This event has ended! But if you'd like to join our future events, hop in to the [freeCodeCamp Discord](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA)!

## Want to get to know Naomi?

We have our own [Discord community for NHCarrigan](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com), which is the perfect place to connect with us on a more personal level!
